# Description
This program is an educational system designed to demonstrate the way that different voting systems influence the results of an election, and therefore the representation of the populace in the government.

The system itself shows three different systems: 
- First Past The Post 
  - The standard most = win
- Single Transferable Vote 
  - One backup vote, where if your first loses, then your vote is given to your next choice
- Rank Choice Voting
  - Ranking all candidates from best to worst, lowest votes eliminated, votes for eliminated go to next choice
